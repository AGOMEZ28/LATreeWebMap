Trees are one of our most valuable resources. In addition to providing shade and beautifying streets, urban trees capture and clean stormwater runoff, remove pollution from the air, store carbon, and produce oxygen. The Los Angeles Tree Web Map is an online mapping application that allows users to explore the vast City of Los Angeles public park and public street right-of-way (ROW) tree inventory. Users can discover areas where trees are densely populated, search for their favorite tree(s) across the city, or visualize the range of tree heights along streets or parks. The application has a variety of features to explore trees across the city. The main feature is the ability to filter the two datasets by tree (common) name, street name, or park name. The application also provides the ability to change tree symbology, view tree characteristics, or change the basemap.
